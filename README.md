Down and Out
============

You are a former lab worker (or a steel-and-glass box). Six years ago, the lab you were working at suffered an explosion. Two were killed. Seven were never found. Now you're going back...

Down and Out is a game, written in JS, about a lab worker's attempt to return to a factory the worker used to work for that, six years before the game takes place, suffered a massive internal explosion inside the lab's "skunk works" (to borrow a Lockheed-Martin term). Two people were confirmed dead and six went missing. The seven, of course, were never found.

The game's puzzle mechanics involve a switching of the gameworld from "map view" (sort of like Pokemon, where you view from above) to "side-scroller" (like the old Mario games) and back without the game elements changing. (But you're not supposed to know that, so don't tell anybody. :P )

Enjoy!
